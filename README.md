How Many Outs
===========

http://howmanyouts.com

I am all about poker.  To help make myself a pinch better, I created a web based poker game to improve my ability to quickly identify outs in a poker hand.  This is my first Python and Flask project, so be nice!  


Development
===========

How Many Out is built in Python on top of the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) microframework.  The quickest way to get started is with virtualenv and a few pip installs.

    sudo easy_install virtualenv
    cd howmanyouts
    virtualenv env
    env/bin/activiate
    pip install Flask
    python howmanyouts.py
